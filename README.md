Just merging some facets of various projects for demonstration and discussion.

Including some visualisation stuff (timeline). along with thew data migration stuff.

figwheel isn't going 100% as initially built a compojure/ring project.
Added the timeline code -- cljs ...

To fire it up,

* lein ring server-headless
